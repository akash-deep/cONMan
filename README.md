# cONMan
ftp python
cONMan is an ftp application which eases the transfer of files between linux based machines over LAN...

The user is free to choose any type of network interface (like )::
lo
enp1s0 
wlp2s0

Both the sender and the receiver have to choose the same network interface..

The sender will be given qa list of ip addresses (present in the LAN) on which a cONMan receiver server is running... The sender chooses the reqd ip (or he/she might enter 0 to refresh list)

the sender then will have to choose the file which is to be sent from GUI file chooser...

The receiver gets a progress bar displayed on the screen ... After it completes the file will have been transferred by then... and both the sender and receiver close connnections mutually .
